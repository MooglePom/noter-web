# Noter

This project will remain a WIP. Current features are below!

- Registering a User
- Signing In
- Listing all notes
- Recycling/Restoring notes from trash
- Sharing notes with other users

## Running

Create a .env file with the ```REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001```
Renaming the .env.example to .env will work as well. 
This value should point to the location of your API. 

```
git clone https://github.com/teevans/noter-web
yarn
yarn run
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000
That will redirect you to login.

## First Startup
You'll want to create a user account the first time you spin this up.
Click the 'Register Now' button at the bottom, and it will take you to the
registration form. 

Once created, it will redirect  you to sign in, where you will be able to sign in
and see your notes...or lack thereof...

Create a note by clicking on the plus sign! 
This will create and save a note for you that you can edit on the right side of your screen!
Edit your note, click the save icon toward the top right of the screen, and you've saved your first note!

## Happy Notering!
